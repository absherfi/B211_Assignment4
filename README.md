Assignment 4 Pandas

Most Similar: Virginica and Versicolor look to be the most similar because they both exhibit positive correlations 
              between petal width and length, and the sepal and petal data show a relatively consistant relationship.
Least Similar: Setosa and Virginica are least alike because of the negative correlations accross the data. Most notably, 
               the strong negative correlation between sepal width and petal length.
The purpose of this project is to analyze the Iris dataset, containing the sample id, species, petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width for each sample.
The analysis includes correlations, averages, medians, and standard deviations for the variables in the dataset.
